As a forest ecology researcher I'm curious about how forested landscapes work, understanding the threats to their function, and predicting their future. I use various analytical tools including GIS and remote sensing platforms that provides insights into the spatial relationships in plant biodiversity. My career trajectory has included more than a decade working throughout the world in environmental consulting, teaching, and research. I'm excited to have joined the [Carnaval lab](https://www.carnavallab.org) as a graduate student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at CCNY in January, 2020. My master's research will focus on remote sensing of ecosystem function in the Atlantic Forest. I'm especially interested in the role of biodiversity and phylogeny in determining function.
